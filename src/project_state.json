    "All major UI transitions/interactions must follow a slow, gentle pacing rule (no abrupt/jumpy reveals); use easing, subtle delays, and smooth fades/slides.",

    "Particle slideshow uses <canvas> with requestAnimationFrame, devicePixelRatio scaling, responsive sizing, and aspect-ratio-correct rendering (no distortion).",
    "Slideshow must preload all images before starting transitions; expose integration functions startParticleSlideshow() and stopParticleSlideshow().",
